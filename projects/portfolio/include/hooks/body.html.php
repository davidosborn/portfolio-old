<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<p>
	I created this portfolio website to supplement my resume, to show off the work that I have done.
	It was written in PHP, HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, and is backward compatible to IE7.
</p>
<p>
	The site incorporates a <em>Responsive Web Design</em>, adjusting itself
	for optimal performance on mobile devices, unexpected resolutions, and
	environments where Javascript is disabled.
</p>
<p>
	Source code is available from the <a href="<?php echo SITE_CODE_LINK?>" target="_top"><?php echo SITE_CODE_HOST?> repository</a>
	under the <a href="<?php echo SITE_CODE_LICENSE_LINK?>"><?php echo SITE_CODE_LICENSE?></a>.
